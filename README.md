Hangout is a web app for friends to suggest and confirm times to hang out.

The primary motivation for this project was to get experience doing a full-stack app myself, plus to make a location where my friends and I could easily display times that work for us to get together. I felt this is something that could be truly helpful as the simplicity, ease of use, and centralized display of information would solve the problem of having to scroll through text chains to find times that are free for most people.

The app features a minimalist Next.js frontend and an Express.js / Node.js backend to handle RESTful API calls to the MongoDB Atlas database. It is deployed via Vercel @ http://hangout-blue.vercel.app
